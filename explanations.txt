Andrew Jackson’s Magical Blunderbuss,
Nicolas Cage farted,
1-877-Kars 4 Kids destroyed it,
There were a ton of ants, like 10 of them,
There was a Bolshevik Revolution,
Things have never been the same since the 60’s...,
I lost my glasses ,
My hamster ran away,
Somebody stole all my chocolate,
Kwanzaa ended yesterday,
That’s the way I like it,
A waiter said “enjoy your food” and I replied “you too!”,
Someone spilled the milk,
The ghost of Stalin gave me a high five,
I ripped the tag off a mattress,
I used the popcorn button on the microwave,
I ordered a pizza with no bread,
Spontaneous Combustion,
Bitten by a radioactive spider,
I felt like it,
Ten men in balaclavas told me to do it,
The President issued me a formal order to do it,
The guest pitcher’s pitch was way off,
It felt like a good idea at the time,
The brakes stopped working,
Inexplicable banana peel,
The stars aligned,
It was in this morning’s horoscope,
I tried this at home,
The bungee cord broke,
I was on a mission from God,
Lightning struck a frog,
Someone pissed off a wizard,
Turned it up to 11,
I set it to wumbo,
It is as the prophecy foretold,
I shot the sheriff,
It was just lying around,
I was really bored,
There was a klondike bar at stake,
Someone impugned my honor,
Life finds a way,
I don’t drive stick,
I forgot to turn it over,
I left the oven on,
If I told you I’d have to kill you,
Vikings invaded,
America learned where the oil was,
Invaded Russia in winter,
Forgot air support,
Danger close,
I threw the pin instead of the grenade,
Someone was wrong on the internet,
Somebody poisoned the water hole,
There was a snake in my boot,
I saw a spider,
Wild horses dragged me away,
I shot Marvin in the face,
We did the fusion dance wrong,
There was a Teleporter accident,
I reversed the polarity,
We crossed the streams,
We tried to float the wagon,
I ran out of toilet paper,
The door was stuck,
The pizza took over 30 minutes to be delivered,
The French revolted,
The French surrendered,
I had to get rid of the evidence,
They were on to me,
They were on top of me,
The mole people began their invasion,
We pushed it somewhere else,
We couldn’t find any twinkies,
It’s past my bedtime,
The chicken wasn’t fully cooked,
The egg came first,
State farm was there,
California Girls are unforgettable,
I’m all out of bubble gum,
Hannah Montana told me to,
It was slippery when wet,
My mustache has a mind of its own,
There was a sale on nitroglycerin,
It was 20% off!,
Waffle House wasn’t really made out of waffles,
My refrigerator was running,
Prince Albert was in fact not in the can,
I had a craving that only hands could satisfy,
Choosy moms choose Jif,
Stacy's mom had it going on,
I just wanted to be pure,
They forgot their jackets,
The cake was a lie,
My mom is a WWE champion,
Penguins invaded Australia,
I had to get the voices to stop,
The banana wasn’t ripe,
I’m not a very good parent,
2 men, 1 burrito,
We stole a leprechaun’s pot of gold,
I was all out of milk,
I’m too good of a friend,
I didn’t actually read the terms of agreement,
I found a dirty magazine in a hedge,
Hulk Hogan brought me to suplex city,
I lost all my money on 9 red,
I gave them the ol’ razzle dazzle,
Aliens probed me,
Taio Cruz stopped making music,
There could be only one,
Pirates began pillaging the Denny’s,
I hate my neighbor,
I cheated on my math test,
I had to.,
The spice must flow,
I have no excuses,
I wanted to be a Pokémon master,
Player one wasn’t ready,
He dropped his croissant,
I got a feeling,
My hemorrhoids were acting up,
Christopher Columbus gave Native Americans measles ,
I burned down an Applebee’s,
I don’t know, something about vodka…,
My multiple concussions,
I got a gin and tonic with vodka instead of tonic,
I got a pet Donkey for Chanukah,
The fire nation attacked,
I wasn’t wearing my seatbelt,
