The room is covered in Fudge
My computer is at the bottom of Lake Ontario
The Town center is painted Red
The neighbor’s dog is frozen in ice
My stove exploded
Switzerland formed an army
My sister yelled at me
Virginia and West Virginia merged into one giant Virginia
I’m scarred for the rest of my life
There is a crater where Paris used to be
All causality is reversed
I’m on fire
Woke up on a mattress in the middle of The English Channel
All the mirrors are broken
There are 50 cats in my house
These mariachi players won’t stop following me
My shorts have a really weird stain on them
The sun won’t stop screaming
My fingers are now hot dogs
My skeleton is no longer part of my body
My house is upside down
She lost the will to live
My parents disowned me
I’m never allowed in an Arby’s again
I’m blind
The pasta isn’t al dente
My family photos are missing
My family left me
There’s a gate to hell in my basement
I fell asleep in a homeless man’s lap
I binged watched every episode of Friends
There’s a dead horse and a pile of salt on my front lawn
The war was cold
Amanda Bynes is in jail again
Australia lost a war against a bunch of birds
I’m straddling a camel
My vomit is rainbow colored
My kid fell into a gorilla exhibit
I’m being held at gunpoint by a chimpanzee
I. Too. Am. Moist.
My socks are soggy
I got kicked out of the sorority house
I’m being held hostage by armed senior citizens
I’m now a ping pong master
There’s an angry mob moving towards the library
There’s an alien in my bedroom
I’m stuck in a gladiatorial arena without any pants
The baby is on fire
I now speak fluent russian
I thought ‘Samurai Cop’ was a good movie
The neighbor’s head is stuck in a bucket of crabs
Snape killed Dumbledore
I only cried for 20 hours
I woke up with a bible and a fifth of vodka
The avengers recruited me
Gypsies cursed my cat
The inquisition burned my wife as a witch
I ran over a cyclist
The milk is spoiled
I ruined the environment
